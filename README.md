# agarose-gel-map-generator

Takes lists of what samples need which tests. Organizes the samples by test in corresponding groups with controls.
These groups are output to the gel map templates, which mirror how the samples will be loaded into agarose gels for genotyping.
This allows us to keep track of samples/tests and where they are in the gels. 
Later, genotypes can be entered in the gel maps and reviewed by the discordancy checker for convergence.
